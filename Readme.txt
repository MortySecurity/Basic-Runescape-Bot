Runescape Bot
The bot memorizes a specific user inputted color of the 'monster' and  its starts attacking that color aka the 'monster'.
This works best if the monster has different colored features than the landscape its self. At the moment this is a very basic script using Autoit; I will be updating it from time to time.

recommended:
- screen size to be Full screen or 1493, 845
- MUST have an optimized GUI in Runescape. Clean up your GUI and make it as minimalistic as possible

Future updates:
- Camera control
- Optimized on all screen sizes
- GUI
